# WorldWarWeapons.com Growth Plan

Last updated: 2026-02-21

## Scope
- Preserve existing Phase 1 technical SEO foundations (indexable home page, metadata, sitemap, robots, schema).
- Execute Phase 2 (topical authority buildout) and Phase 3 (distribution/authority flywheel).
- Add a Reddit distribution system that drives qualified traffic without violating subreddit rules.

## North Star and KPIs
- North star: qualified organic sessions to weapon detail pages.
- KPI 1: non-brand impressions (Google Search Console).
- KPI 2: organic clicks to `/[category]/[slug]` pages.
- KPI 3: referring sessions from Reddit.
- KPI 4: pages with at least 1 click in last 28 days.
- KPI 5: links earned from third-party history/education domains.

## Phase 2 (Weeks 2-8): Topical Authority

### 1) Build intent clusters as new landing pages
- Cluster A: comparison pages.
- Cluster B: country + weapon class pages.
- Cluster C: battle + loadout pages.

Suggested page templates:
- `/compare/m1-garand-vs-kar98k`
- `/compare/t-34-vs-panzer-iv`
- `/country/us/rifles`
- `/country/de/tanks`
- `/battles/normandy-weapons`
- `/battles/stalingrad-weapons`

Template structure:
- Intro summary (40-90 words).
- Fast comparison table.
- Doctrine and battlefield context.
- Internal links to 6-12 existing detail pages.
- Short FAQ block (3-5 questions).

### 2) Internal linking graph
- Add “Related weapons” on each detail page:
- Same country.
- Same category/subcategory.
- Same battle references in `notableUses`.
- Add “Compare with” links for obvious rivals.
- Ensure every new landing page links to at least 8 detail pages.

### 3) On-page quality upgrades
- Standardize intro quality: first paragraph should answer “what is it + why it mattered”.
- Add factual captions under images (search and UX benefit).
- Normalize terminology:
- Use one canonical name in title/H1.
- Keep aliases inside body text.

### 4) Publishing cadence
- Week plan:
- 2 comparison pages.
- 1 country+class page.
- 1 battle page.
- 4 weeks = 16 new indexable pages.

### Phase 2 success gates
- +30% indexed pages with impressions.
- +20% organic clicks to detail pages.
- At least 10 long-tail queries driving clicks.

## Phase 3 (Weeks 8-16): Authority + Distribution Flywheel

### 1) Linkable assets
- Create high-value “reference assets” that people cite:
- WW2 weapon timeline (interactive).
- Printable PDF comparison sheets.
- “Battle loadout maps” by theater/year.

### 2) Digital PR and outreach
- Target:
- military history blogs/newsletters
- museum resource pages
- teacher/history curriculum pages
- Offer embeddable visuals with attribution link.
- Pitch one asset per month with a short evidence-led email.

### 3) Refresh loop
- Every 30 days:
- update top 20 traffic pages
- improve snippets, add internal links, strengthen FAQs
- Every 60 days:
- consolidate underperforming overlapping pages

### 4) Measurement loop
- Weekly dashboard:
- top gaining queries
- top decaying pages
- CTR outliers (high impression, low click)
- Monthly decisions:
- scale winning cluster types
- kill/merge weak clusters

### Phase 3 success gates
- 30+ pages with active monthly clicks.
- 10+ quality referring domains.
- Stable month-over-month growth in non-brand search clicks.

## Reddit Distribution Strategy

## Principles
- Reddit is community-first: lead with useful context, not link drops.
- Follow each subreddit’s rules before posting.
- Give complete value in-post; link only when it genuinely adds depth.
- Ratio target: at least 8-10 non-promotional contributions per 1 link post.

## Subreddit mix
- Core history communities.
- Military history communities.
- Topic-specific media communities (tanks/aircraft/warships).
- Geography or education communities when content matches local/history context.

Use this mix:
- 60% comments (no links, high-value insights).
- 30% text posts with embedded value + optional source link.
- 10% direct link posts (only where explicitly allowed).

## Content formats that work
- “Explainer” posts:
- Example: why T-34 design choices mattered more than headline armor thickness.
- “Comparison” posts:
- Example: M1 Garand vs Kar98k in doctrine, logistics, and training context.
- “Myth-busting” posts:
- Example: common misconceptions about specific WW2 weapons.
- “Primary-source-backed threads”:
- Include brief source citations and invite corrections.

## Safe posting workflow
1. Preflight:
- check subreddit rules
- check similar recent posts
- pick one clear takeaway
2. Draft:
- 120-300 words useful on its own
- add image or table where allowed
- optional link in last line: “full breakdown here”
3. Engage:
- respond to top comments within first 2 hours
- edit post to clarify based on feedback
4. Repurpose:
- turn best-comment discussions into new site pages/FAQs

## Weekly Reddit operating cadence
- 3 days/week.
- 2 high-value comments/day in relevant threads.
- 1 original post/week in one subreddit only.
- 1 cross-post/week max (only where rules permit).

## What to avoid
- Posting the same link in multiple subs same day.
- Title bait or sensational claims.
- Arguing with moderators/rule-lawyering.
- Dropping links without standalone value.

## Reddit KPIs
- Referral sessions from reddit.com.
- Engaged sessions from Reddit (time on page and pages/session).
- Saves/upvote rate on text posts.
- Comment-to-post ratio.
- Conversions to newsletter/bookmark/follow action (if added later).

## 30-Day Reddit Sprint
- Week 1:
- establish account credibility via comments only.
- Week 2:
- 1 explainer post + 8-12 comments.
- Week 3:
- 1 comparison post + 8-12 comments.
- Week 4:
- 1 myth-busting post + 8-12 comments.
- Review:
- double down on post archetypes with best engaged traffic.

## Execution Notes
- Keep a simple tracker with:
- subreddit
- post type
- URL used
- upvotes/comments
- referral sessions
- engaged session rate
- Treat Reddit as research + distribution:
- top comments reveal wording that should become page titles and FAQs.
